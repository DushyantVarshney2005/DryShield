# DryShield - Automatic Rain Protection for Clothes

# üåßÔ∏è Overview

DryShield is an innovative solution designed to protect clothes from unexpected rainfall. During monsoon seasons, clothes left out to dry often get drenched due to sudden showers. DryShield automatically detects rainfall and activates a mechanism that deploys a plastic cover to shield the clothes‚Äîensuring they stay dry even in unpredictable weather.

# üõ†Ô∏è Features

Automatic Rain Detection using FC-37 Rain Sensor

Motorized Plastic Cover Deployment controlled via Arduino

Reversible Motor Motion depending on rain detection

Simple & Cost-effective Design

# ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

Rain Detection: The FC-37 sensor detects water contact.

Motor Control: If rain is detected, two motors roll out a plastic cover; if the rain stops, the cover retracts.

Arduino Logic: Handles sensor input and controls motor output for a 3-second forward/reverse cycle.

# üß© Components Used

FC-37 Rain Sensor

L298N Motor Driver

2x DC Motors

Arduino Board

Jumper Wires, Pipes, Plastic Cover, Hooks


DryShield served as a practical learning experience in electronics, coding, and team collaboration. It tackled a real-world problem with a functional, hands-on solution‚Äîdemonstrating the potential of simple automation in daily life.
